        <h2>Kardashev scale</h2>

        <p class="highlight center">The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological
            advancement based on the amount of
            energy they are able to use.</p>

        <div class="center">
            <p>
                In 1964, Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev defined three levels of civilizations, based on the order
                of
                magnitude of
                power available to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scale has three designated categories:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Type I civilization / Planetary civilization</strong><br>
                can use and store all of the energy which reaches its planet from its parent star.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Type II civilization / Stellar civilization</strong><br>
                can harness the total energy of its planet's parent star.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Type III civilization / Galactic civilization</strong><br>
                can control energy on the scale of its entire host galaxy.
            </p>

            <p class="highlight red-text align-left">
                Together as humans we're facing climate change, wars, pollution, economic inequality, hate crimes,
                violation of civil
                rights, government distrust, natural resource depletion and more of horrendous issues that need to be
                resolved in order
                to reach the next state of human civilization.
                <br><br>
                Humans are currently at Type 0 civilization.

                "These civilizations can effectively control the entire resources of their planet; they can predict
                weather patterns and
                earthquakes very accurately, and even control them using artificially induced greenhouse effects or
                space-based lasers.
                A Type 1 Civilization could conceivably halt an ice-age."

            <p>
                The symbol derives from abstraction. It's not culturally biased and allows iteration as we progress. The
                Earth's flag is
                a part of our solar system flags. By accepting the symbol, we are accepting (current) values
                (compassion, love, peace,
                knowledge, truth, responsibility/service, honour and progress) in order to reach Planetary civilization.
                This, of
                course, is a suggestion.

            <p>
                Design logic from the Flag of Earth stays the same and can be applied on all planet's flags from our
                Solar
                system. The
                distance from the Sun and the number of the moons of course changes. The design is still in progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: Saturn has 53 moons. None of them should be excluded, so they are presented equally.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flag's designs can change in relation to new discoveries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: New moon is discovered.
            </p>

            <h4>Criticism</h4>

            <p>
                Having so many flags offers a potential scenario for dividing us once more. Evolving into Type II
                civilization would be
                reasonable as one solar system and not as one of the planets.

        <h2>History</h2>

        <div class="center">
            <p>
                Planetary civilization flag was designed by <strong>Miha Artnak & Srđan Prodanović</strong> at Studio
                Ljudje in January,
                2013. Miha
                continued with the research and designed it into a system.
            </p>
            <p>
                While working on a design project a question sparked our imagination. What would our planet's flag look
                like? We didn't
                do any research, we just separately drew what we thought was the logical visual representation. We
                immediately noticed
                that we had an identical solution. Only this drove us into research.
            </p>
            <p>
                We found out there were few attempts already put to practice. The logic of our predecessors was the
                same. Earth as a
                planet in our solar system. We even found almost exact design being made in 1979 by James W. Cadle
                (USA). This proved we
                were on a right path. Having the same ideas and opinions about the visual representation of our homeland
                in a different
                time and place brought us closer also culturally.

                Ideas spread under the flags are just opinions. Trolling, hate speech, bullshit, dumb stuff and
                manipulation should not
                sabotage the faith in humanity or destroy the symbol. The symbol is our mirror. We are culturally,
                mentally and
                politically diverse and most of the time just don't agree. This time we need to step together as one and
                start rewriting
